# Hands-On OCI Projects: Practical Learning with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

This repository contains complete **step-by-step guides** and resources for learning **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** through real, hands-on projects — all using the **Always Free Tier**.

Whether you're new to cloud or preparing for OCI certifications, the best way to learn is by building!

### Current Projects

1. **IAM: Building a Secure Development Environment from Scratch**  
   Master OCI **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** by creating a secure, isolated setup with compartments, identity domains, users, groups, and least-privilege policies.  
   Folder: `oci-iam-hands-on/`  

2. **Load Balancing with Apache Web Servers**  
   Build a highly available web application using OCI **Load Balancer** and **Weighted Round Robin** policy.  
   Learn private subnets, backend sets, health checks, and public access through a load balancer.  
   Folder: `load-balancer-apache/`
   
### Why These Projects?

- **IAM** → Security foundation every cloud engineer must master  
- **Load Balancing** → Core networking & high-availability skills for production workloads  
- Both are **100% doable on OCI Free Tier**  
- Follow real-world best practices (private subnets, least privilege, traffic distribution)

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with **IAM** (security first!)  
   → Folder: `oci-iam-hands-on/`

2. Then build the **Load Balancer + Web Servers** project  
   → Folder: `load-balancer-apache/`

Each project folder contains:
- Detailed **README.md** with step-by-step instructions
- **Screenshots/** subfolder for visual walkthroughs
- Ready-to-use configuration files and policy statements (where applicable)

### Prerequisites (for all projects)

- Free OCI account (Always Free tier)
- Access to OCI Console
- Basic familiarity with the OCI Console (you'll learn as you go!)

Happy building and learning! ☁️🚀
