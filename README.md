# Hands-On OCI IAM: Building a Secure Development Environment from Scratch

This repository contains a complete step-by-step guide and resources for learning **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management (IAM)** through practical, hands-on exercises.

If you're new to OCI, the **best way to learn** is by doing — especially starting with IAM. This project helps you understand the core concepts of **authentication** (who you are) and **authorization** (what you can do) by creating a secure, isolated development environment.

### Why Start with IAM?
- IAM is the foundation of security in OCI
- Teaches **compartments**, **identity domains**, **users**, **groups**, and **policies**
- Follows the principle of **least privilege**
- Prevents costly security mistakes later

### What You'll Build
A mini secure setup simulating a real dev team:
1. Isolated **Compartment** for development resources
2. Dedicated **Identity Domain**
3. New **User** with email-based login
4. **Group** for managing permissions
5. Targeted **IAM Policies** for day-to-day tasks (e.g., manage compute instances, block volumes)
6. Test login and resource access

### Prerequisites
- Free OCI account (Always Free tier is perfect!)
- Access to OCI Console
- A personal email address (for user creation & verification)
